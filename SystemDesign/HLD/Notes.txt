System Design

- For system design I have these resources
- The below list is in order(based on my own experience)

    Sudocode channel on Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/c/sudoCODE/playlists) system design playlist - 
    This playlist will give you what you need to know before tackling any of the system design questions.

    This specific video from codeKarle youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cODCpXtPHbQ of when to choose which database.

    This book : System Design Interview by Alex Su (you don't have to purchase this, you can find this online,
     I don't know if this subreddit will allow to post the link)

 you can do direct meetings with them over google meet or zoom, no need to use pramp.

    Gaurav sen's Youtube channel (This is more for full length mock interviews)



Some other things I learned specific to system design were, there are 4 parts to every system design.

    Asking clarifying questions

    functional requirements

    Non-functional requirements

    Api design

    Database structure
    Every question I get I do the above 5 things in order and then start to draw design.
